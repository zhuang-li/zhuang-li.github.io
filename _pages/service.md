## Service and Contributions

### Open Source Contributions

I have contributed to several open-source projects that advance **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML):**

- **Starcoder2 Project**  
  - Contributed to the development of an open-source coding LLM, led by Hugging Face. 
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2)  

- **FACTUAL: Text Scene Graph Parsing**  
  - Built FACTUAL, a text scene graph parser, in collaboration with **Adobe** and **Wuhan University**.  
  - Impact: Downloaded over **31,000 times** from PyPI and **130,000 times** from Hugging Face Models.  
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zhuang-li/FactualSceneGraph)  

- **SCAR: Data Selection Tool for LLM Fine-tuning**  
  - Developed SCAR, a state-of-the-art tool for data selection that enhances LLM performance while reducing dataset size.  
  - Impact: Downloaded over **5,000 times** from PyPI.  
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zhuang-li/SCAR)
