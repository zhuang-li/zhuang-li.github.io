## Welcome!

Hello! My name is **Zhuang Li**, and I am a **Lecturer at RMIT University** and formerly a **Research Fellow at Monash University**. My expertise lies in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with a focus on **semantic parsing**, **social NLP**, **culturally-inclusive AI**, and **data-efficient NLP**. I am passionate about developing neural-symbolic methods to align large language models with diverse social norms, striving for an inclusive world where AI systems respect and adapt to different cultural backgrounds. My research also focuses on applying semantic parsing to dialogue systems in low-resource settings.

## About Me

I earned my PhD from **Monash University**, where I was mentored by **Dr. Lizhen Qu**, **Prof. Gholamreza Haffari**, and **ACL Fellow Phil Cohen**. Throughout my career, I have mentored junior researchers, helping them publish in prestigious venues such as **AAAI**, **EMNLP**, and **EACL**. I am dedicated to fostering innovation and collaboration in the NLP community.

## Research Interests

### Natural Language Processing
- **Semantic Parsing**: Transforming natural language utterances into machine-readable meaning representations for applications such as dialogue systems.  
- **Social NLP and Culturally-Inclusive AI**: Aligning NLP systems, including large language models, with diverse social norms to ensure inclusivity and cultural sensitivity.  
- **Data-Efficient NLP**: Enhancing NLP model performance while minimizing the need for large amounts of labeled data.  

### Machine Learning
- **Continual and Active Learning**: Developing models that adapt and improve over time through ongoing learning and active sampling.  
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Leveraging limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled data to build robust and efficient models.
