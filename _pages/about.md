Hi. My name is Zhuang Li, currently a Ph.D. candidate at Monash University. My research topic is mainly about natural language processing, particularly semantic parsing, which has a wide application in the dialogue and question answering systems. During the Ph.D. study, I am honored to be advised by Dr. [[Lizhen Qu]](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=cHXZgHUAAAAJ&hl=en), Associate Professor [[‪Gholamreza Haffari‬]](https://users.monash.edu.au/~gholamrh/) and AAAI,ACM, ACL fellow [[Phil Cohen]](https://www.openstream.ai/os-about.html). I also earned my master's and bachelor's degrees from the [[Australian National University]](https://www.anu.edu.au/) and [[Wuhan University of Science and Technology]](http://www.wust.edu.cn/english/) in 2015 and 2013. In the past, I worked on the dialogue system and Bing in the STCA NLP group, [[Microsoft]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/), Suzhou, and on the financial machine learning applications in the [[ASTRI]](https://www.astri.org/sc/), Hong Kong.

##### I am always interested in collaboration with other researchers in various NLP research topics such as Semantic Parsing, Question Answering, Dialogue System, Adversarial Attack, etc. 
##### Welcome to drop me an email if you are interested!
