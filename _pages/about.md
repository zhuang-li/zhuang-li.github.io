Hi. My name is Zhuang Li, currently a Ph.D. candidate from the Monash University. My research topic is mainly about natural language processing, particularly semantic parsing, which has a wide application in the dialogue system and question answering. During the Ph.D. stage, I am honored to be advised by [[Dr. Lizhen Qu]](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=cHXZgHUAAAAJ&hl=en), Associate Professor [[‪Gholamreza Haffari‬]](https://users.monash.edu.au/~gholamrh/) and AAAI,ACM, ACL fellow [[Phil Cohen]](https://www.openstream.ai/os-about.html). I also earned my master's and bachelor's degree from the [[Australian National University]](https://www.anu.edu.au/) and [[Wuhan University of Science and Technology]](http://www.wust.edu.cn/english/) in 2015 and 2013. In the past, I worked in the STCA NLP group, [[Microsoft]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/), Suzhou, on the dialogue system and the search engine and in the [[ASTRI]](https://www.astri.org/sc/), Hong Kong on the financial applications.

More about me.

Welcome to browse around to know more about me. I particularly like watching movies and reading books. I like to watch horror and sci-fi movies and reading books about history and economics. And I am an amateur trader in China and the US stock markets and could get 18% profit on average within the recent four years.
