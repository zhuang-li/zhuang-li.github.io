## Greetings

Hello! My name is Zhuang Li, and I am currently a research fellow at Monash University, where I also completed my PhD. My research primarily focuses on natural language processing, particularly in semantic parsing, which plays a crucial role in dialogue and question answering systems. Lately, I've pivoted towards social NLP.

## Education and Mentorship

I was privileged to be mentored by Dr. Lizhen Qu, Associate Professor Gholamreza Haffari, and AAAI, ACM, ACL fellow Phil Cohen during my PhD. I hold master's and bachelor's degrees from the Australian National University and Wuhan University of Science and Technology, respectively.

## Professional Experience

Previously, I worked on dialogue systems and Bing in the STCA NLP group at Microsoft, Suzhou.

## Collaboration and Supervision

I am keen on collaborating in various NLP research areas, including Semantic Parsing, Question Answering, Dialogue Systems, and Adversarial Attack. Additionally, I'm experienced in supervising junior researchers, having guided students to success in top-tier venues and tech giants. I welcome inquiries about collaboration or supervision!

## Internship Opportunities

I'm involved in a collaborative project with Ant Group, focusing on the alignment of Large Language Models with social values. This project includes internship opportunities at Ant Group. Interested candidates are encouraged to contact me for more information.
